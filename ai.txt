In Supervised learning, you train the machine using data which is  well "labeled. .Supervised
learning model takes direct feedback to check if it is predicting correct output or not.

un Supervised learning mainly deals with the unlabelled data. Unsupervised learning algorithms allow you to 
perform more complex processing tasks compared to supervised learning. 


Regression: This type can be used when the output variable is a real or continuous value. 
For example, salary based on work experience, or weight based on height, etc.

Classification: 
To find whether an email received is a spam or ham
To identify customer segments
To find if a bank loan is granted
To identify if a kid will pass or fail in an examination
  

Decision Tree: find out if a person is fit or not. Based on a series of test conditions,

Random Forest :  A random forest, is making a bunch of decision trees, and consulting 
all of them at once to make your decision.  Let's say you had to make a big life decision, and you
 knew it came down to some factors: Health, happiness, finances, philosophy
And different factors have different importance

Naive Bayes :  assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to 
the presence of any other feature. For example, a fruit may be considered to be an
 apple if it is red, round, and about 3 inches in diameter. aa

Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data and no  corresponding output
 Variable .The machine works by searching a pattern in the unlabeled data and 
then responds. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find the hidden patterns and useful 
insights from the unknown dataset.

Clustering: In clustering, objects are divided into clusters that are similar but are dissimilar to 
the objects belonging to another cluster. Like, finding out which customers made similar 
product purchases.

Association: As the name suggests, it discovers the probability of the co-occurrence of items in a
Collection. 

Neural Nets (NN) are an ML technique. They are layered structures. Their first
layer is where the inputs are applied. The final layer is where the computed 
outputs are made available. The layers that reside between the input and output layers are called the hidden (neuron) layers as they are not
directly connected to the outside world.
NNs having a single or no hidden layer are called Shallow NNs

A neural net is said to learn supervised, if the desired output is already known.
While learning, one of the input patterns is given to the net's input layer
Neural nets that learn unsupervised have no such target outputs. 
It can't be determined what the result of the learning process will look like.

Training a Neural Network, 
Lets train our network to predict someonegender given their weight
 and height:
3 things are happening here. First, each input is multiplied 
by a weight
Next, all the weighted inputs are added together with a bias bb
Finally, the sum is passed through an activation function:

The activation function is used to turn an unbounded input 
into an output that has a nice, predictable form. A commonly
 used activation function is the sigmoid function:

A sigmoid function is a type of activation function, and more specifically defined 
as a squashing function, which limits the output to a range between 0 and 1.

TensorFlow is a machine learning / deep learning / multilayer neural network 
library from Google. Libraries using data flow graphs can be used to describe 
complex networks in an easy-to-understand manner. With high versatility, 
it can be used from the research level to real products.
By using this neural network, machines can perform logical thinking and 
learning similar to humans
